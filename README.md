## SOME-KIND-OF-DEVLOG-IDK (README IS A MESS BUT ¯/\_(ツ)_/¯):
Jan 3rd 2023: Currently doing some css for the app. added a toggle content button to display some information about the app itself and the cool API it's fetchting from. Still deciding on a color pattern for the app. Want to use something cheerfu, instead of Tarkov's depressing color pallete xD
